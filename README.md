# KGE-ActivityRecommendation
This is the supplementary reposititory for the paper:
"Knowledge Graph Completion for Activity Recommendation in Business Process Modeling"

We are currently cleaning up and refatcoring our code, it will be available at latest on 25.11.2023.

# Installation
As it is mentioned in our paper, we relied on the PyTorch-based library [libKGE](https://github.com/uma-pi1/kge) to apply knowledge graph embedding models. Therefore, first you need to install libKGE based on the guide provided [here](https://github.com/uma-pi1/kge#quick-start)https://github.com/uma-pi1/kge#quick-start).
